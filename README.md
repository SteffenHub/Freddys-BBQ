### Run all Microservices using Docker Compose
You can run all microservices using `docker-compose.yml`.
Ensure you have Docker Desktop installed and running.
```sh
  docker-compose up
```
After running the command, the following services will be available:
- Customer Frontend â†’ [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
- Staff Frontend â†’ [http://localhost:4300](http://localhost:4300)
- Order Backend (API) â†’ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

To save costs when hosting on Render.com, the microservices are combined into a single deployment.  
The release version merges all required services into one application (see `Dockerfile` in the root directory).

To start the release version:
```sh
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-release.yml up
```
